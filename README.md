# CoMapeo Desktop

Go to the [Development](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) docs to learn about how the project is structured and how to work on it locally.

## Quick Start

Make sure you have the preferred versions of tooling installed:

- [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org): [22.19.0](./.nvmrc)
- [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm): 11.6.2

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/digidem/comapeo-desktop.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application in development mode:

   ```sh
   node --run start
   ```

   Alternatively can use npm (although it will be a bit slower for things to start) i.e.

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
